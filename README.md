# Improving_Unsupervised_Defect_Segmentation

This is Keras code from "Improving Unsupervised Defect Segmentation by Applying Structural Similarity to Autoencoders".
https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02011
I tried for my computer vision research. 
That's is amazing method for unsupervised defect segmentation using AutoEncoder with SSIM.

# Usage
## 1. Use AutoEncoder

You can use your images with AutoEncoder.py.
Please set your Image Path and automatically be resized on this code 128*128*1.

## 2. Use SSIM

Next time, you can compare Inpue Image and Decoded Image.

*Sorry I still write for the SSIM. Coming soon...
